}
\arguments{
\item{n, m, k}{Numeric scalars. \code{n} represents the total population size;
\code{m} represents the infected population size; \code{k} represents the
healing population size.}

\item{fixedAllocation}{logical with default set to \code{FALSE}. When \code{FALSE},
group sizes are randomly determined using probability given \code{{n,m,k}}.
When \code{TRUE}, groups sizes will be exactly as stated given \code{{n,m,k}}.}

\item{infect}{numeric value between 0 and 1. This represents the probability
of rate of change from one status to another on contact.}

\item{infect_radius}{numeric value between 0 and 1. Represents the radius within which an
individual can experience a status change when exposed}

\item{nIterations}{positive integer. Represents the number of trials to run
where each individual's status and position may be updated.}

\item{flight}{logical with default set to \code{TRUE}. When \code{TRUE}, the infected are
programmed to repel from the healers. When \code{FALSE}, the infected are programmed
to be attracted to the non-infected.
infected.}

\item{x}{an object of class \code{wd2}}

\item{...}{additional arguments affecting the summary produced.}

\item{object}{an object of class \code{wd2}}
}
\description{
This package simulates the events of infection (of susceptible subjects)
and immunization (of infected subjects) in a population of susceptible, infected,
and immunized individuals. The function is still at the development stage and thus has a
limited number of arguments that can be altered for the simulation process.
